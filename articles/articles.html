                        <p class="lead">Over the past few months, the electricity usage of bitcoin and other similar blockchain networks have pulled them into 
                            a larger conversation around sustainability. But lost in this has been the massive potential for smart contracts – 
                            fully traceable, transparent and irreversible self-executing contracts, running on blockchains – to contribute to the fight against climate change. 
                        </p>    
                        <p class = "lead">Smart contracts allow us to design globally accessible and fully automated incentive systems that can directly reward individuals, 
                            companies and governments for taking part in sustainable practices – such as regenerative agriculture, carbon offsets, crop insurance and more. 
                            At its core, the fight against climate change is going to require a massive shift in global consumption habits, 
                            and smart contracts are an incredible tool for incentivizing participation in global green initiatives.</p>

                            The year-to-date (January-July) global surface temperature was also the sixth-warmest on record. 
                            According to NCEI’s Global Annual Temperature Outlook, 
                            there is a greater than 99% chance that 2022 will rank among the 10-warmest years on record 
                            but only an 11% chance that it will rank among the top five.

                        <p class="lead">Electric vehicles are growing in political popularity, with President Biden's signing of the 
                            Inflation Reduction Act that invests $400 billion in energy security and fighting climate change and California's push to eliminate 
                            new sales of gas-powered cars. Just a simple switch to electric vehicles is crucial and significant in limiting fossil fuels and global warming, 
                            but without a clean power grid to back them up, they can't reach their full planet-saving potential. </p>
